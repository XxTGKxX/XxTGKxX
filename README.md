Hello, I'm Briggybean, but you can call me Bri!
Formerly known as XxTGKxX.

I'm a girl who makes Discord bots and Ren'Py games.
I'm the lead artist of Mistakes Were Made, a work-in-progress RPG game.

DDLC got me into coding. I make a lot of silly DDLC mods in my free time which will never be shared (lol).
I also love Cells At Work, OMORI, Hetalia, and Needy Streamer Overload.
I'm a big fan of crossovers, which has led me to start working on Doki Doki Gakuen Hetalia (DDGH) âœ¨
